# google-cloud-kubernetes-configs

These are just dumps of my GCP Kubernetes configurations. 

For setting up Redis, ElasticSearch, MongoDB, HTTPS nodes etc. These are just configurations that I copied out of projects I've worked on in the past in order to have a repository of Kubernetes configurations.
